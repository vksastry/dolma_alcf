## Data Example
The expected document in a file (in other terms, a jsonl entry/line in each jsonl file). Important to note that, the dolma toolkit requires 'id' associated with each of the jsonl files to be used.

It is one of the four months to have 30 days.\nApril always begins on the same day of the week as July, and additionally, January in leap years. April always ends on the same day of the week as December.\nThe Month.\nApril comes between March and May, making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as June, September and November are later in the year.\nApril begins on the same day of the week as July every year and on the same day of the week as January in leap years. April ends on the same day of the week as December every year, as each other\'s last days are exactly 35 weeks (245 days) apart.\nIn common years, April starts on the same day of the week as October of the previous year, and in leap years, May of the previous year. In common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as July of the previous year, and in leap years, February and October of the previous year. In common years immediately after other common years, April starts on the same day of the week as January of the previous year, and in leap years and years immediately after that, April finishes on the same day of the week as January of the previous year.\nIn years immediately before common years, April starts on the same day of the week as September and December of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, June of the following year. In years immediately before common years, April finishes on the same day of the week as September of the following year, and in years immediately before leap years, March and June of the following year.\nApril is a spring month in the Northern Hemisphere and an autumn/fall month in the Southern Hemisphere. In each hemisphere, it is the seasonal equivalent of October in the other.\nIt is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the Latin word "aperire", meaning "to open", referring to flowers opening in spring. Another theory is that the name could come from Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. It was originally the second month in the old Roman Calendar, before the start of the new year was put to January 1.\nQuite a few festivals are held in this month. In many Southeast Asian cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including Songkran). In Western Christianity, Easter can be celebrated on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25. In Orthodox Christianity, it can fall between April 4 and May 8. At the end of the month, Central and Northern European cultures celebrate Walpurgis Night on April 30, marking the transition from winter into summer.\nApril in poetry.\nPoets use "April" to mean the end of winter. For example: "April showers bring May flowers."', 'created': '2023-10-01T00:00:00.000Z', 'added': '2024-01-24T20:02:59.580Z', 'metadata': {'revid': '9086769', 'url': 'https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1', 'length': 600}}â€‹

## Directory structure 

The dolma toolkit has some dependency on the structure of the input directory. It assumes that the directory structure has the following directory tree. Ex: `{$PARENT_DIR}/documents/*.gz` where the `*.gz` are the jsonl files compressed under that directory. 
Ex: The wikipedia dataset uses: wikipedia/v0/documents/*.gz
